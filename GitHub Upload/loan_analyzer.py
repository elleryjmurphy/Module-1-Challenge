"""Part 3: Perform Financial Calculations.

Perform financial calculations using functions.

1. Define a new function that will be used to calculate present value.
    a. This function should include parameters for `future_value`, `remaining_months`, and the `annual_discount_rate`
    b. The function should return the `present_value` for the loan.
2. Use the function to calculate the present value of the new loan given below.
    a. Use an `annual_discount_rate` of 0.2 for this new loan calculation.

In this section, you will use a loop to iterate through a series of loans and select only the inexpensive loans.

1. Create a new, empty list called `inexpensive_loans`.
2. Use a for loop to select each loan from a list of loans.
    a. Inside the for loop, write an if-statement to determine if the loan_price is less than or equal to 500
    b. If the loan_price is less than or equal to 500 then append that loan to the `inexpensive_loans` list.

Output this list of inexpensive loans to a csv file
    1. Use `with open` to open a new CSV file.
        a. Create a `csvwriter` using the `csv` library.
        b. Use the new csvwriter to write the header variable as the first row.
        c. Use a for loop to iterate through each loan in `inexpensive_loans`.
            i. Use the csvwriter to write the `loan.values()` to a row in the CSV file.

    Hint: Refer to the official documentation for the csv library.
